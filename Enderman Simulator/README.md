# CG-OpenGL-Project

What's up, gamers!,

This repository was made to contain our university project for the subject computer graphics.
Our project involved making a small game or simulator. We decided on making an enderman simulator.
Those fond with the game Minecraft, might know what an Enderman is. Click [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enderman) for the minecraft wiki page.
In short, an enderman:

- Picks up blocks at random.
- Can teleport.
- Can move very fast.
- An enemy mob that appears at night in the game mc.
  And guess what, you'll be wandering around a world made using OpenGL, as an enderman!

Enjoy!
PS: This project has a texture bug for the skymaps and certain textures (After countless days, we gave up on fixing this bug).
