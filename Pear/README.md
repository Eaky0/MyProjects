# Pear

Hello there, Intelligent minds!

This project involves a file distribution application called Pear. I made this app,
together with 3 other students from my university. Our aim of making this application is 
to avoid complexity and increase usability. Pear identifies itself as a user-friendly file transfer
application which ignores asking the user too much. Might as well call it the linux of file transfer!
The application's supportability is currently limited to Windows users. It was made with Python and 
frameworks like kivy and twisted.

Enjoy transfering files!
