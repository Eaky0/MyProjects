Hi folks!

Yea, this one was definitely unique in my opinion. I was inspired by the nintendo switch. So I made a simple console using electronic parts and the arduino framework which 
runs the game Tic-Tac-Toe. Vector files for laser cutting are available, in case you wish to try making it yourself too.
