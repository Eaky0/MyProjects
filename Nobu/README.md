# Nobu

Hey there, designing-lovers!

I made this project with 2 other students. The goal was to design an application, the appropiate way. It's a restaurant 
reservation application with quite the special service. It was made using flutter and dart consisting of a mix of mockery and functionality. 
Nobu is designed for medium-sized phones, so you might expect suprises of overflow warnings. Nonetheless, it's nicely made for the rest!
