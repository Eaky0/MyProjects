# Simple Step

Hi, melomaniacs!,

Me and my friends attempted on making a music application. It went... Meh. As it was our first time playing with digital music,
we didn't know what to expect. It ended up looking quite well and consists of a lot of functionality. 
We made a simple step sequencer requested by a client (a professor at school). After asking his preferences and
desires, we started our research on how we could realize our application. 
After writing documentation and drawing design sketches, we continued with the implementation.
We realized how related our project was with physics. It certainly was a tough challenge.
We got 90% of all the work done, except for one essential part: Recording what you made.
The performance is honestly, not the best. For reference, it was coded in C++ using the JUCE framework, which was 
specialized in music application development (until we realized you had to pay for more music tools ðŸ˜ž).
However, at the end if the day, we we're happy with what we made. It taught us a lot!
Introducing. Simple step, a step sequencer!

Enjoy making some music!

Advice (derived from additional research): If you ever plan on doing something similar. Don't start with a desktop application, make a 
web app instead. We noticed how the web provided a lot of tools for digital music. Working with digital music is cool, but I'll stick with using existing DAW's and Music apps.
